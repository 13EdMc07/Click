The problem my app is trying to solve

My app is a game designed to test your memory.
How is this app organized:

My app is composed of 4 components all rendered together into the App.js file.
The components are as follows:
Card: The cards that are displayed to be clicked.
Nav: The nav bar that displays the user score and highscore.
Title: The text displayed instructing the user.
Wrapper: The component that holds everything together.
The App.js contains imports of all of these components and use various function to facilitate the game logic.
How to run the app:
